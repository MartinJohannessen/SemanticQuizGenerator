# SemanticQuizGenerator
The semantic quiz generator is a Java and Jena project that automatically generates questions and hints from a knowledge graph. 

1. You run the program by running the main in QuizGeneratorMain.java

2. After you run the program you will be asked to enter how many countries you want in your quiz. Enter an int.

3. If your computer is slow you may have to wait a few seconds before the quiz starts. Take this time to read the rules of the game.

4. If weird characters appear in the terminal, the console encoding is most likely set to Cp1252 or ASCII. Change the encoding to UTF-8.
